# Personal notes

I will use this in order to share ideas, keep organized some tricks I find usefull in my day-to-day work or just write some thoughts down. 
I will try to write them in English, but some could be in Spanish, depending on the subject and target (if it is another than just me).

List of posts:

* [Maratón + nómada = desastre](posts/maraton_fallida.md)
* [Looking new project](posts/looking_new_project.md)
