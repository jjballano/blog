# Looking for new opportunities
#####(03/02/2017)

For more than 10 years I have been working as a software developer, last 5 as a freelancer. I have helped a few startups to start or improve their products, including one which trusted in me to be partner in exchange for my work, so yeah, I own a (small) part of a company! but only spend a few hours a months on it.

Since I started as a self-employed, I became what people like to say "digital nomad", so I had to get used to work remotely and I like it, although sometime I miss spending some time with colleagues.

Last year, I have been working as the only developer in a few projects and got tired of it. It is boring, sometimes frustrating (hello [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)) and cannot grow as fast as I would like because no one around to learn from. This is not what I want, so need a change.

### What am I looking for?

A project to work part time. I'm currently working for a client and takes me around 70 hours a month, so I have another 70-90 hours available.
It can be a paid project but not only. Open source to contribute or people with a good idea but not software development knowledge looking for someone to build a MVP, are also welcome.

This is my nice to have list:

##### Technologies
* Ruby. Not an expert, but do enjoy writing lines of code in this language. A couple of projects made by myself with RoR has made me want to explore this language more deeply.
* Groovy. My dark past as a Java dev (just kidding) and a few projects with Grails makes me want to continue working with Groovy and think it is one of the languages I know the most. 
* JS. I am not into this [crazy time for JS environment](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.hmpy5k4bh) but I have worked in some projects where had to code a lot of js lines and enjoyed it. I cannot consider myself "front end developer", but a fast learner.
* I am even comfortable with HTML/CSS. Me from 5 years ago, yes, you will enjoy front-end stuff.
* Anything else? Yeah why not! 

##### Team
* Work in a team where all learn from each other. I rather work with more people than alone.

##### Place
* I will spend sometime in Valencia (Spain), so would work there or remote. I could go for a few days every now and then to wherever the company is based in order to catch up with project and team.
